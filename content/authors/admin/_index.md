      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Spiros Chavlis received his diploma degree (equivalent to M.Eng.) in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 2011, his M.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2013, and his Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece, in 2018. During his doctoral studies, he developed a computational model of the hippocampal dentate gyrus examining the role of dendrites in the pattern separation mnemonic process. He is a Postdoctoral Researcher in computational neuroscience with the Poirazi Lab, IMBB-FORTH. He is interested in unraveling the underlying mechanisms of memory formation and learning using computational models of the hippocampal subregions and incorporating them in bio-inspired deep learning architectures.
